        <p>With just a few store-bought ingredients (or homemade ingredients, if you’re feeling particularly ambitious), you can make a showstopping centerpiece for your next birthday party or special occasion, stacked with ice-cold layers of cake, ice cream and all kinds of goodies.</p>
        <p>To construct your ice cream cake, you'll be alternating layers of ice cream with cake, or with crumbled cookies, or even with dessert sauces like chocolate or butterscotch. When making an ice cream cake, it's essential to work quickly, so that the ice cream doesn't melt. Otherwise, ice crystals could form when you freeze the finished cake. Here's our step-by-step guide to how to make a delicious ice cream cake.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cake layers</li>
            <li>3 cups of ice cream, at room temperature for 15 minutes</li>
            <li>Crunchy filling (such as crushed cookie bits, crushed brownies or chocolate chips)</li>
            <li>Topping for decorating the top of the cake (such as fudge sauce, meringue or whipped cream)</li>
            <li>Sheet pan, lined with plastic wrap, frozen for 15 minutes</li>
            <li>Large spoon</li>
            <li>Offset spatula</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Place a cake layer on the sheet tray and top with ice cream. Carefully transfer your first cake layer to the plastic wrap-lined and chilled sheet tray. Spoon 1.5 cups of softened ice cream all over the top of the cake layer.</li>
            <li>Smooth out the ice cream. Using a knife or offset spatula, smooth the ice cream so it covers the entire cake layer. You should have a thick, solid layer of ice cream.</li>
            <li>Top the ice cream with crunchy filling. Top the ice cream with a layer of crushed cookies, brownie bits or chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Top the crunchy bits with more ice cream. Spoon the remaining 1.5 cups of softened ice cream all over the toppings.</li>
            <li>Spread out the second layer of ice cream. Smooth the ice cream so it covers the crushed cookies or the crunchy layer of your choosing.</li>
            <li>Add the second cake layer and freeze. Top the ice cream with the second cake layer. Then place the cake in the freezer for 1 to 2 hours or until the cake and ice cream is completely frozen (it should be hard to the touch).</li>
            <li>Remove cake from freezer and add topping. You want to make sure your finished creation doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan, so pull up the plastic wrap "handles" and very gently pull the cake from the pan. Spread topping, such as fudge sauce, meringue or whipped cream, over the cake and place it back in the freezer for an hour, or until it sets.</li>
        </ol>
